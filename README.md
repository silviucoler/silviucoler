# Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hi there! I'm Silviu. I am an aspiring web developer looking to move into the field. Despite having no prior experience, I am eager to learn and grow my skills through self-teaching and online courses. I am passionate about using technology to create beautiful, functional, and impactful solutions and am excited to take on new challenges as I move forward in my journey as a web developer.

## Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

- **Project 1**: [Personal Site](https://github.com/silviucoler/finalCapstone)
  - The site is designed to give visitors an insight into what makes me unique and what I enjoy doing in my free time. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with JSON and DOM manipulation to create an interactive and engaging user experience. These technologies enabled me to add dynamic features and enhance the overall look and functionality of the site.
- **Project 2**: [City Information API](https://github.com/silviucoler/cityApi)
  - This code uses async/await and the Fetch API to make two HTTP requests to external APIs to retrieve information about a city's name, population, elevation, and current temperature. The responses are processed and logged to the console. The code also includes a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during the API requests. The data retrieved is in JSON format and is transformed into a JavaScript object for easy access to the information.
- **Project 3**: [Salary Manager](https://github.com/silviucoler/SalaryManager)
  - This is a basic JavaScript program that uses object oriented programming to implementg a way to manage the salaries of three types of employees: salaried, hourly, and hybrid.
