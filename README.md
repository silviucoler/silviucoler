# Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hi there! I'm Silviu. I am an aspiring software developer looking to move into the field. Despite having no prior experience, I am eager to learn and grow my skills through self-teaching and online courses. I am passionate about using technology to create beautiful, functional, and impactful solutions and am excited to take on new challenges as I move forward in my journey as a developer.

## Projects

Here are some of my projects:

- **Project 1**: [Hangman Game](https://github.com/silviucoler/Hangman-Game)
  - This is a Hangman game made with React. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words, and the player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and each incorrect guess results in a part of a hangman being drawn. If the player runs out of attempts, the game is over, and the word is revealed. If the player guesses the word correctly, the player wins the game.
- **Project 2**: [Project Management App](https://github.com/silviucoler/Project-Management-App)
  - This project is a web application built using React, React Bootstrap and Express. It fetches data from APIs hosted on a local server, and allows the user to add new projects, as well as edit or delete previous projects.
- **Project 3**: [Personal Site](https://github.com/silviucoler/Personal-Site)
  - The site is designed to give visitors an insight into what makes me unique and what I enjoy doing in my free time. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with JSON and DOM manipulation to create an interactive and engaging user experience. These technologies enabled me to add dynamic features and enhance the overall look and functionality of the site.
